## âœ… Submission Readiness Checklist

### ðŸ”¥ Must Be Done Before Submission (Tonight / Tomorrow Morning)

- [ ] **Client Onboarding**  
      Add a "What to Expect" section or info icon in `WelcomeScreen` for new users.

- [ ] **Spacing / Typography Consistency**  
      Check paddings, font sizes, and layout across all screens to ensure a unified look.

- [ ] **Visual Polish for Feedback Screens**  
      Add simple visuals or design cues to `FeedbackDataScreen` and `FinalReviewScreen`.  
      Use `SplashScreen` as visual inspiration.

- [ ] **README Polish**  
      Finalize `README.md`:
  - [ ] Confirm copy-paste runnable setup instructions.
  - [ ] Add **"Future Features"** section for roadmap items.

### ðŸ§  Optional (Post-Submission: While Waiting on Code Review)

- [ ] **Add Some Test Coverage**  
      Even basic `jest` unit tests for API logic or componentsâ€”just to show testing familiarity.

- [ ] **Remove Extraneous Data from MongoDB**  
      Clean out any test users, habits, and team members not relevant to your final flow.

- [ ] **Sharpen UI in `ReviewScreen` & `FeedbackDataScreen`**  
      (Optional only if already clean and readable. Otherwise, bump up priority.)

### ðŸ’¡ Suggestion

Include `seed.js` or `POSTMAN` collection for reviewers to simulate user + feedback creation.
